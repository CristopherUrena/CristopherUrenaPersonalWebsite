Cristopher Urena's Personal Website is a website designed to showcase my projects and general information. It took me some time to get it finished and I came accross some issues related to the adaptation of the website when opened on different devices. This is my first real project so there are a lot of things that can be better but I hope that throughout my learning experience I can update it.
